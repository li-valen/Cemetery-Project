In the excerpt, it can be seen that one James H. Campbell from Williamsport was studying at Dickinson Law School from the years 1840 to 1841. It additionally provides his exact date of enrollment, June 16, 1840, as well as the month of graduation, August.\nFrom this, it can be seen that Campbell received his education in law from Dickinson Law College, which, according to the Archives Department at Dickinson, is partially affiliated with the modern Dickinson College. It can also be inferred from this catalog that Campbell was born in Williamsport, as it is unlikely he moved residences before enrolling at the age of 20. As Dickinson Law College is located in Carlisle, it can be determined that Campbell resided in Carlisle for approximately a year of his life while studying. This also substantiates other documents detailing his admission onto the Bar in 1841 as it matches the year of his graduation from the Law Department.",

Lib. of Congress. <https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85055199/1849-12-12/ed-1/seq-1/>\nThe document is a newspaper clipping of a poem written by Juliet Hamersly Campbell, the wife of James Hepburn Campbell. Published in the Lewisburg Chronicle and the West Branch Farmer on December 12, 1849, Juliet's poem titled <quote>Hungary<quote> likely depicts the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 where Hungarians and other ethnic minorities in the country sought full independence from the Habsburg crown. \nThe publication of her poem depicts her successful career as an author during the Victorian Age. It is yet another sign of great wealth for the Campbell family as not only was education for women relatively reserved for the very wealthy but also the opportunity to be published was often only granted to wealthier families. The topic of the poem itself can also be used to infer that Juliet was indeed a woman of <quote>rare intellectual qualities<quote> who was aware of the political woes of the world; the language used in her writing reflects a high level of education and creativity. From this, it can be concluded that Juliet was both an accomplished author and a descendant from an affluent family that would have enabled her to cultivate such talent.",

Image 164 of 180.\nIn this 1850 Federal Census, James H. Campbell, and his immediate family/dependents living in his house, are documented. It can be seen that in 1850 Campbell resided in the South Ward of Pottsville, Schuylkill County, in Pennsylvania. It can also be recognized that by 1850, Campbell had started his law practice and was likely the main provider of his family as he was the sole breadwinner.\nIt can be observed that in 1850, Campbell was 30 years old, placing his year of birth in 1820. It can also be seen that persons unrelated by blood to Campbell, Charles Beal and Mary Davis, were listed under his name and that Charles Beal was a ‘laborer’ of color whilst Mary Davis was born in Wales. As Beal was a laborer and Davis was illiterate, it can be deduced that Campbell had hired at least two household workers/servants, one Black and one Welsh, indicating a respectable degree of wealth to Campbell’s name.",

Campbell made on the House Floor he supported Andrew H. Reeder, the Democratic governor of Kansas. This support calls into question the legitimacy of John Wilkins Whitfield, who he alleges was illegally elected as a representative of the Kansas Territory via an <quote>invading force from the State of Missouri.<quote> Campbell makes it clear that the issue does not simply lie between Reeder and Whitfield but the whole Kansas-Nebraska Act debacle and the lack of democratic processes in the territories. Campbell repeatedly calls on the government to launch deeper investigations into the affair and wants to make it clear to the American people the true legitimacy of the Kansas government and legislature. \nFrom this speech, it can be concluded that Campbell was not in support of the Kansas-Nebraska Act as well as the political violence occurring in the Western territories. Campbell’s temperament as a fair and logical thinker can also be seen, seeing as how Campbell did not criticize the affair solely on political bases but also through laws and investigation. It can be inferred that Campbell was an anti-slavery politician, seeing as how he supported Reeder—a Democrat politician who later joined the Free-State party—as opposed to Whitfield, a Democrat politician who later fought for the Confederate Army.",

New York: Rudd & Carleton, 1858, https://hdl.handle.net/2027/hvd.h x5gtd. \nThis document is a novel by James Cambell’s wife, Juliet H. L. Campbell, who was an author at the time. This 370-page work of literature was her only book ever published; however, she was known mainly for her poems that were published in other places. She begins the novel by dedicating it to her father, and James Campbell’s father-in-law, Judge Ellis Lewis. In her note, she seems to find many faults in her work and asks her father to forgive her if he is displeased with anything written.\nThis novel shows the creativity that James Cambell’s wife had when it came to things such as literature, even managing to publish a book at a time when it was quite difficult to do. Her dedication almost appears as a plea to the father to like her work, giving off the feeling that she aims to please her father through this book but is scared she won’t. The novel also serves as a testament to Juliet’s success as a writer, being published by a company on Broadway. As Juliet explores themes of female independence and education, it can be inferred that Juliet was an early believer of feminist ideals that would later spring up in 20th-century America.",

It certifies his age as being 63 years of age, born in Williamsport, PA, with his occupation being a lawyer, his date of entered service was April 18, 1861, as a Private in the Washington Battalion and was discharged in July 1861 as Major of the 25th Regiment of Pennsylvania.\n	This document can be corroborated by multiple other documents to conclude that Campbell enlisted in a temporary three-month contract early into the war, and by 1883 Campbell was a lawyer. This document also serves as proof that Campbell was born in the city of Williamsport, PA. and that Campbell was elected as Major only after enlisting as a Private.",

Campbell discussed the stalemate occurring on the Eastern front of the Civil War which was causing discontent in the Republican Party and Washington. Peskin discusses how Campbell was a fairly vocal advocate for vigorous military methods and details his times as a military officer. It also goes into the fact that Campbell was unseated from Congress due to the anti-war sentiment in his home district and was consoled with a diplomatic post as minister to Sweden and Norway. Peskin writes that Campbell, after his return from his assignment at Stockholm, dedicated his time to his practice of law and Pennsylvania ‘farm’.\nThis article indicates that Campbell was an important member of Washington, leading delegations concerning important military issues due to his previous involvement in the military. This also goes into detail about how he lost his seat in Congress and how he was such a main government proponent he was kept around to be the minister to Sweden and Norway. From this, we know he was passionate about military legislation and gave his <quote>urge for immediate action<quote> after he recognized a problem. Some insight into his retirement from the government to his legal practice and Pennsylvania farm is also provided as well as his military doctrine.",

In this letter as the Chairman of the Select Committee of Pacific R. R Campbell wants to express his thanks to Judah for helping aid the Pacific Railroad Company through Congress. This consisted of assisting in the funding and building of a national railroad that would span from the Missouri River to the Pacific Ocean. Its main purpose was to easily transport mineral resources around the country to help with expansion.\nJudah was the chief engineer and one of the agents sent by the company to request the funds from Washington and this letter indicates the excitement that Campbell had toward the prospect of westward expansion. It appears that this railroad proposal worked in tandem along with his ideas of how to progress the country forward. This document also proves that James H. Campbell was in fact the Chairman of the Select Committee of the Pacific Railroad in 1862, something that other directories fail to show.",
    "\nDocumentU\nCampbell, James H. Speech of Jas. H. Campbell of Penna. in H. of Rep., April 8, 1862 on the Pacific Railroad Bill. 1862. James Hepburn Campbell, Historical Society of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA. https://drive.google.com/file/d/11y9oZb4EKjWjT0w27O5ycAwQqhr9fJLw/view?usp=sharing\nThese photos do not represent the entire speech.\n	\nIn this speech made in the House of Representatives on April 8, 1862, by Campbell, he emphasizes the importance of the Pacific Railroad and argues that it will strengthen and unify their country. He believed that they could not only secure trade and connect with the East and West, but also sought to relieve internal traffic, aid with foreign commerce, and grant more land. The extension of this railroad was also linked to the proposed idea of building a telegraph line that would extend from the Missouri River to the Pacific Ocean, creating an efficient line of communication and transportation. Mentioned also were the specific details and costs of the plan, with the prices of the railroad and distance calculated, Campbell carefully planned out the full blueprint of this idea.\nFrom this speech, we can infer that Campbell was a strategic and wise man who did not fail to collect and prepare information supporting his ideas and arguments. His speeches, including this one, are carefully written out, and supported with evidence, calculations, and logical reasoning, only revealing that he is a tactical man. He was likely able to work in such high positions in the government due to his political mindset, as he consistently thinks about how his proposed ideas will benefit the country as a whole presently and in the future.",
    "\nDocumentV\nUnited States, Congress, House of Representatives. Journal of the House of Representatives of the United States: Second Session of the Thirty-Seventh Congress. vol. 59. Washington: Government Printing Office, 1862. https://voteview.com/source_images/house_journal/59/0#page.\nThis journal sourced from the Congressional Globe documents the voting history of the 34th Congress—the journal details how Mr. Campbell sponsored the Pacific Railroad Act of 1862 and had it passed through Congress to be signed into law on July 1st. This volume also shows Campbell’s support for the Morrill Land-Grant Acts which were passed to create land-grant colleges like Penn State and MIT by using the proceeds from land sales. \nThis piece of information is yet another example of how Campbell’s work influenced America as the Transcontinental Railroad projects were a key part of industrialization for America. His vote on this specific bill corroborates other documents that assert his positive attitude towards the construction of the Pacific Railroad, and that he was in fact on the select committee on the Pacific Railroad. It can also be inferred from the document that while Campbell supported increased access to education through the Land-Grant Acts, he was not considering the lives of Native Americans—whose land was exploited for the Act—when deciding on this piece of legislation. The source website (voteview) additionally provides an analysis of Campbell’s voting patterns; it details that his beliefs were more liberal than 61% of other Republicans. Campbell’s relatively left ideology for the Republican party helps prove that Campbell was not a so-called Radical Republican.",

In a letter only five days following the plot, Campbell, in a half-report half-personal letter to Seward, wrote about how he admired Lincoln and prayed for the quick recovery of Seward. In these letters, Campbell’s intimate relationships with Manderström, Lincoln, and Seward are put on full display; particularly, his idolization of Abraham Lincoln as a politician and fighter is made clear and suggests a political mentor of his. From this, it can be inferred that Campbell possessed a humble yet thoughtful personality while also maintaining close relationships with Seward and Manderström. \nOverall, it can be inferred from these documents that Campbell held political figures like Lincoln in high regard.

In a letter only five days following the plot, Campbell, in a half-report half-personal letter to Seward, wrote about how he admired Lincoln and prayed for the quick recovery of Seward. In these letters, Campbell’s intimate relationships with Manderström, Lincoln, and Seward are put on full display; particularly, his idolization of Abraham Lincoln as a politician and fighter is made clear and suggests a political mentor of his. From this, it can be inferred that Campbell possessed a humble yet thoughtful personality while also maintaining close relationships with Seward and Manderström. \nOverall, it can be inferred from these documents that Campbell held political figures like Lincoln in high regard.

Translated by u/Hxawax, James Hepburn Campbell, Historical Society of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.\nThis document is a commendation of James H. Campbell by the French Institut d’Afrique which was founded to advocate for the abolition of human trafficking and slavery. According to information online, l’Institut d’Afrique was an organization that, oddly, supported colonization as well, and it—along with its members—was heavily centered in Paris., The General Secretary of the institute wrote that the organization would be <quote>flattered<quote> to call him a President of Honor, a paid rank in the organization.\nFrom this document, it can be inferred that Campbell’s efforts against the spread of slavery were recognized on an international scale, given his commendation by a French institute. Furthermore, on the basis that l’Institut d’Afrique’s members were based in Paris, and that the title of <quote>President d’Honneur<quote> required its members to pay in Francs, it can be inferred that Campbell likely stayed in Paris for some time in 1865 during his service as Resident Minister to Sweden. This can be corroborated by how, in the previous request of laissez-passer from the Swedish Foreign Office, Campbell was described as having <quote>expressed desire<quote> to travel to France. \nMonsieur,\nL'institut d'Afrique fondé pour l'abolition de la traite et le l'Esclavage, serait tres flatté de vous compter au nombre de ses <quote>Presidents d'Honneur.<quote> Esprit éclairé et généreux, vous comprendrez cette glorieuse tâche et vous aimerez a vous y associer.

Translated by u/gloubenterder, James Hepburn Campbell, Historical Society of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.\n	This document is a request for free travel for Resident Minister Sweden-Norway James H. Campbell from the Swedish-Norwegian Prime Minister’s Office for Foreign Affairs. Free passage for Campbell between European states such as Germany and France is requested in the appeal issued by Swedish Prime Minister of Foreign Affairs Ludvig Mandterstrom. It is made clear that Campbell, of his own volition, expressed desire to travel to said countries. \n	From this request it can be inferred that Campbell felt compelled to explore the relationships/politics of other European nations; Campbell likely had business regarding Sweden and with other countries in Europe and thus expressed a desire to travel there. This possibly could have tied in with the shift in European geopolitics after the Second Schleswig War between Germany and Denmark, something that Campbell briefly mentioned in his correspondences with Secretary of State William H.

James Hepburn Campbell, Historical Society of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. \nThis letter written by McGinnis Jr., a diplomatic official, on February 21st, 1867, to James H. Campbell, details McGinnis’s experience with the diplomatic nomination; he requests that James H. Campbell forward official letters after the Senate rejected his nomination/secession as Resident Minister at Stockholm. It was discovered that Campbell was to become Resident Minister of Bogota, and McGinnis to be Resident Minister of Stockholm; however, McGinnis’ appointment was rejected by the Senate which caused a disruption in their plans. \nIt can be inferred that Campbell and McGinnis were well acquainted and that Campbell was indeed nominated to be the Resident Minister to Colombia. This letter can be used to connect Campbell’s appointment as Resident Minister of Bogota, the position of which he politely rejected, and his accepted position as Resident Minister of Stockholm. The document also suggests the general timeframe in which Campbell served as the Resident Minister to Sweden based on the date at which Campbell was supposed to leave for Paris.\n<quote>Paris-\n21st February 1867\nMy dear Sir: \n	On the 15th day of November 1866, you were [illegible] Minister Resident at Bogota, and, I to be a Minister Resident in Stockholm. On the 27th day of December, I took my instructions to and left Washington having the permission of the President and Secretary of State to proceed to Paris and there wait for the action of the Senate on my nomination. On 12th day of January, I left New York and reached Paris 26th day of the same month. It was on that very day my nomination was rejected by the Senate. Of their action, I was promptly advised and, after meeting with Senator Dix, concluded not to present my letter of evidence to the King of Norway and Sweden.\n	I doubt not the President and Secretary of State have addressed me at Stockholm and I have therefore to request that you will forward all letters which may now be in waiting for me there - as were as those arriving hereafter. You are at liberty to open all dispatches from the President or from the State Department, if it be necessary to place any of them on file at the Legation, be kind enough to send me copies, Hoping the original for that purpose. \n	I would have written you long since open this subject, but have been expecting to meet you here, from day to day, as Mr. Seward thought you would join your family in France, and said he had instructed you to proceed to Bogota without delay.\nHoping your nomination may receive more consideration than mine has - and that the change from Stockholm to Bogota may prove acceptable and agreeable to you and your family-\nI am with high respect\nYour friend, \nJno: McGinnis Jr.\nHon:  J.

As this section of S. 6th Street was also known as Lawyer’s Row in Philadelphia at the time, it can be inferred from his address that Campbell was a prominent lawyer in Philadelphia at the time. Additionally, as prior business directories for Philadelphia (there was an absence of directories from ‘67 to ‘76) did not list Campbell as a lawyer, it can be inferred that Campbell moved to Philadelphia during this time period. As multiple other lawyers were listed under the 130 S. 6th Street address, it can be inferred that Campbell either worked at a law firm in the building or headed his own law firm with his own workers.",

Another bit of information that is catalogued is their race, gender, age, and where they and their parents were born.\n	This helps to paint a better picture of Campbell in his later life and his relationship with his work as even at 60 years of age he was still working as a lawyer after coming back from his stay as Minister of Sweden. While Campbell’s birth year has been corroborated with many sources this census helps to strengthen his wife's and daughter's birth years being 1823-4 and 1853-4 respectively.",

The article states that the student was named Christopher Little and that he was a successful and well-known lawyer in Pottsville, PA. It also says that Little studied under Campbell for the four years he worked as an editor for the Miners Journal. From the clipping, we can infer that he was a student under Campbell from 1849-1853. \nThe document serves as proof that Campbell moved to Pottsville, Pennsylvania, and established a successful legal practice. Furthermore, it shows that Campbell not only owned and worked as a lawyer but also as a law mentor to students like Little. The timeline of the events described in the newspaper clipping aligns with the timeline created through the project.

Campbell began his political ventures as a member of the Whig party but as that was disbanded he fell into line with the newly created Republican party just at the time the Civil War broke out.

His involvement in the days leading up to the Civil War as well as his activities post-Congress are also documented, notably his declination of the position in South Africa which is not detailed in other sources. His political relationships prior to his first election can also be inferred from the biography, particularly his relationships with N. P. Banks and Henry Clay.

Campbell was quite an affluent retiree following his service in Congress and work as a lawyer, as the Aeola estate appears large and well-kept. As the house is also listed on the Radnor Historical Society archives in the first place, the house itself was likely grand and of high value. The entry also provides the address of the estate, which provides the final residence of Mr. Campbell before his passing.",
    "\nDocumentAV\n1901 England Census for Julia Wharton Lewis Keightley <quote>Julia Wharton Lewis Keightley.<quote> 1901 England Census, The National Archives, Kew, Surrey, England, RG 13. Ancestry.com, www.ancestry.com . Accessed 17 Jan. 2025.\nThis document is a 1901 census for one of Campbell’s daughters, Julia Campbell, now known as Julia Wharton Lewis Keightley. Along with her in this census is her husband Archibald Keightley along with their servant, Alice Barneby, and four daughters in 141 Wildwood North Bend. Their ages are also present in this information with Julia being 50 and her husband being 44. Archibald is also labeled as a physician on his own account  while Julia is labeled as <quote>wife.<quote>\n	This lends insight into the fact that even though some siblings like Sarah Ann Campbell stayed in the States, after Julia left her parent's house from 1880 to 1901 she managed to make her way over to England and start a family with Archibald Keightley. This does though raise some confusion as the 1880 census indicated that she had been born in 1854 while this one indicates that it was in 1851 another query that was raised was how could she have a daughter that is 32 years old but not born in the states which meant that in 1880 we would have had to already been living in England. This leads to the conclusion that either information was falsified on the US census or the England census.\nName and Surname\nRelation to Head of Family\nCondition as to Marriage\nAge last Birthday of\nProfession or Occupation\nEmployer, Worker, or Own account\nIf Working at Home\nWHERE BORN\nArchibald Keightley\nHead\nM\n44\nPhysician\nOwn account\nLancaster(?)

    "\nDocumentAW\n<quote>Sarah Ann Campbell.<quote> Return of a Death in the City of Philadelphia, 3 Jan. 1905, Board of Health, Philadelphia. FamilySearch, https://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/KZS3-K8X/jane-hepburn-1795-1867. Accessed 17 Jan. 2025.\nThis document is a death certificate of one of James Campbell’s sisters, Sarah Ann Campbell. From this, it can be seen that she died in 1905 at the age of 79 in her house at 2225 N 17th St. Philadelphia PA, and that the cause of her death was gangrene of her feet. It can also be seen that she was buried in Laurel Hill cemetery rather than with the rest of the family at the Woodlands. \nThis document allows us to have a better idea of where the Campbell family and their specific members resided as well as how one of them died. The cause of death was gangrene of her feet which was a relatively common way to die as the death rate of the disease at the time was a little more than 50%. A better picture can also be drawn of where the family’s final resting places are from this document because if they are not buried in the Woodlands it's most likely that they ended up in Laurel Hill.",
