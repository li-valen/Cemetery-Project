        <p class="c4"><span class="c10">Tradition says that the name Hepburn is derived from the names of two
                rivers—it is likely that the original Hepburn clan in Scotland lived near bodies of water (Document
                AR). The name had multiple variations before being finalized as Hepburn; these included Heborn,
                Hepbron, </span><span class="c10">Hepborn</span><span class="c6">, d’Hepburne, and even Esbron. The
                Hepburn Campbell family was of Scottish origin and had ties with the Earls of Bothwell in the
                Peerage of Scotland; Campbell's great-grandfather had direct ancestry to Rev. John Hepburn of Keith
                and remote ancestry to Patrick Hepburn, the third Lord Hailes and first Earl of Bothwell. It was in
                1698 that Campbell's great-grandfather from his maternal side, Samuel Hepburn, was born in Glasgow,
                Scotland. In 1746 he married Janet Sinclair, a Scottish woman and soon to be great-grandmother of
                James. Campbell. </span></p>
        <p class="c3 c7"><span class="c6"></span></p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c6">Shortly after their marriage, they left Scotland due to religious persecution
                and settled in Donegal, Ireland (Document AR). They resided there for many years, in that time
                bearing four sons and one daughter: James, William, Samuel, John, and Janet Hepburn. At one point,
                Campbell's grandfather and great-grandfather received news of how America was the land of
                opportunity. This prompted Campbell's maternal grandfather, James Hepburn (age 26 at the time), and
                his brother, William Hepburn (age 18 at the time), to sail from Londonderry to Philadelphia in early
                1773 to verify the promises of America for their father, Campbell's great grandfather. James Hepburn
                was satisfied with the advantages it would come to provide and settled in Philadelphia, making
                occasional trips back to the valley to assist with landwatching. With his wife and daughter, who
                unfortunately drowned during a storm, Samuel Hepburn sailed on the Faithful Steward from Londonderry
                to Philadelphia. His son James Hepburn and Mary Hopewell Hepburn would go on to get married on
                December 17, 1781, and have nine children: Samuel Hopewell Hepburn, Andrew Doz Hepburn, William
                Hepburn, James Hepburn, Jane Hepburn (Campbell's mother), Mary Hepburn, Hopewell Hepburn, William
                Hepburn and Sarah Hepburn. &nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class="c4"><span class="c10">James H. Campbell’s father, Francis C. </span><span class="c10">Campbell,
                was</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;born in 1787 and grew up in York, Pennsylvania (Document AR). He
                went on to pursue his education at Dickinson College, where he, alongside his close friend David
                Watts, studied law and laid a path for his future son to soon follow (Document AX). After earning
                his law degree, Francis relocated to Williamsport, Pennsylvania, where he met and married his future
                wife, Jane H. Campbell. While in Williamsport, he not only built a successful legal career spanning
                an impressive 50 years but also became a prominent and respected figure within the Lycoming County
                bar. He eventually died in 1867 shortly before the passing of his wife.</span><sup class="c10"><a

        <p class="c4"><span class="c10">James H. Campbell’s mother, Jane H. </span><span class="c10">Campbell,
                was</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;born on March 19, 1775 to James Hepburn and Mary Hopewell
                (Document AR). She was the sixth child of nine and the eldest daughter of her family. Her siblings
                were Samuel H. Hepburn, Andrew Doz Hepburn, William Hepburn, James Hepburn, John Hepburn, Mary
                Hepburn, Hopewell Hepburn, and Sarah Hepburn. Little is documented about her early life. However, it
                is known that she married Francis C. Campbell in May of 1816 and had nine children with him before
                passing at the age of 72 on </span><span class="c10 c25">May 17, 1867</span><span

        <p class="c3 c7"><span class="c6"></span></p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c10">Campbell had many siblings, including Catherine C. Campbell, Elizabeth
                Campbell, Francis C. Campbell, Frances H. Campbell, John R. Campbell, Alfred Campbell, Mary J.
                Campbell, and Sarah A. Campbell, born from 1818 to 1839 (Document AR).</span><sup class="c10"><a
                    href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup><span class="c10">&nbsp;Although James had quite a
                number of siblings, many died within the first year of their lives. Besides James, Sarah Ann
                Campbell was the best documented of the children </span><span class="c10">with</span><span
                class="c10">&nbsp;the 1860 U.S. Census documenting her residence at her parent's house (Document K).
                Sarah resided at 2225 N 17th Street in Philadelphia for much of her life until her death in 1905
                (Document AW). She was buried in Laurel Hill Cemetery which indicates that while some of the
                Campbell family was buried in the Woodlands another portion is in the Laurel Hill
                Cemetery.</span><sup class="c10"><a href="#ftnt4" id="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup></p>
        <p class="c3 c7"><span class="c6"></span></p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c10">On February 8, 1820, James Hepburn Campbell himself was born in
                Williamsport, Pennsylvania to Francis C. Campbell and Jane H. Campbell (Document AR). Campbell grew
                up in a relatively affluent household, seeing as how his father Francis was a successful lawyer.
                Coincidentally, he grew up across the street from his future wife, Juliet Hamersley
                Lewis.</span><sup class="c10"><a href="#ftnt5" id="ftnt_ref5">[5]</a></sup><span
                class="c10">&nbsp;It was in Williamsport that Campbell “almost certainly” received his early
                education.</span><sup class="c10"><a href="#ftnt6" id="ftnt_ref6">[6]</a></sup></p>
        <p class="c4 c24"><span class="c6"></span></p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c10">On June 16, 1840, Campbell enrolled in Dickinson Law School which was headed
                by the local Judge John Reed in Carlisle, PA (Document A). According to the Department of Archives
                at Dickinson College, while Campbell did not live in Dickinson College housing, it is likely
                Campbell lived somewhere within the city based on the distance between Williamsport and
                Carlisle.</span><sup class="c10"><a href="#ftnt7" id="ftnt_ref7">[7]</a></sup><span
                class="c6">&nbsp;Campbell received his Bachelor of Laws diploma and graduated from the 16th Class in
                August of 1841.</span></p>
        <p class="c4 c24"><span class="c6"></span></p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c10">After he graduated from Dickinson Law College, Campbell moved to the South
                Ward of Pottsville and was admitted to the Bar on October 18, 1841 (Document B; Document D).
            </span><span class="c10 c14">In June of 1843, James Hepburn Campbell married Juliet Hamersley Campbell,
                formerly Juliet Hamersley Lewis. Juliet was born on August 5, 1823, to her parents, Ellis Lewis and
                Josephine Wallis Lewis.</span><sup class="c10 c14"><a href="#ftnt8"
                    id="ftnt_ref8">[8]</a></sup><span class="c10 c14">&nbsp;Her father, Ellis, was appointed
                Attorney General for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1833, and it was then that he relocated
                their whole family to Williamsport, Pennsylvania, where Juliet and James met. Her parents had sent
                her to the Moravian Seminary for Young Ladies in 1835 and later to a French Boarding School in
                Philadelphia. The influences of her father and her education led her to begin writing at the age of
                14; she eventually became an author, writing multiple full-length books and featuring her poetry in
                several national magazines. &nbsp;Some of Juliet's most notable works included: her novel "The Old
                Love and the New" and poems in </span><span class="c10 c13">Shell Music, </span><span

                Julia Wharton Lewis Campbell, Ellis Lewis Campbell, James Jr. Campbell, and Francis Campbell, and as
                the wife to James H. Campbell. </span></p>

        <p class="c4"><span class="c10 c14">Juliet and James had their first son, Francis D. Campbell, in 1845; two
                years later, their son, James Jr. Campbell was born in 1847 (Document D). Francis was notably the
                Master’s Mate on the “Black Hawk” which was the flagship of the Mississippi Squadron; he resigned
                from his position on August 8, 1863 (Document AB). Unfortunately, both passed after fighting in the
                Civil War in 1864 and thus, little is documented about their lives.</span><sup class="c10 c14"><a
                    href="#ftnt11" id="ftnt_ref11">[11]</a></sup><span class="c10 c14">&nbsp;In 1854, they welcomed
                another son named Ellis Lewis Campbell. Ellis became a lawyer in Philadelphia like his father,
                marrying Ada C. </span><span class="c10 c14">Smith </span><span class="c10 c14">and passing

                in 1851 or 1854, and her break into the literary world occurred following the deaths of her husband
                and two children, all of whom she lost within two years.</span><sup class="c10 c14"><a

        <p class="c4"><span class="c10 c14">After the death of her husband, she moved back home and lived with her
                parents for a while to aid her recovery from the illnesses she developed after the trauma of losing
                her husband and sons. During this period, she wrote two successful plays and learned about the Aryan
                Theosophical Society. On May 27, 1886, Julia officially joined the Aryan Theosophical Society,
                helping to write several magazines in </span><span class="c10 c13">The Path</span><span

        <p class="c4"><span class="c6">After moving to Pottsville, Pennsylvania, he established a successful legal
                practice and married Juliet Lewis in 1843. Campbell's interest in politics emerged in 1844 when he
                attended the Whig National Convention in Baltimore, marking the beginning of his involvement in
                public service (Document AX). There, Campbell developed a close relationship with the influential
                Henry Clay whom he supported for presidency. </span></p>
        <p class="c3 c7"><span class="c6"></span></p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c6">Campbell additionally served as the host of celebrations and parades due to
                his status as a prominent lawyer in the city. Such celebrations and parades included the celebration
                of the Good Intent Engine fire brigade and the victory of the Pottsville Cricket Club (Document E).
                Campbell’s role in hosting these celebrations indicate that Campbell was influential in the social
                scene and possibly owned a large property in the city.</span></p>
        <p class="c3 c7"><span class="c6"></span></p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c6">In Pottsville, Campbell also joined the Miner’s Lodge of the Independent
                Order of Odd Fellows, a fraternal organization dedicated to community service and treatment for the
                sick (Document E). There, Campbell was responsible for providing the charter to the organization on
                December 9, 1851. As a lawyer, Campbell also assisted the organization of various companies,
                including the Pottsville Mutual and Joint Stock Life Insurance Company, of which he was an
                incorporator. </span></p>
        <p class="c3 c7"><span class="c6"></span></p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c6">While presumably running a law firm in Pottsville, Campbell also mentored a
                number of students in law, including prominent Pottsville lawyers George Little, Christopher Little,
                and William Lebbeus Whitney (Document AO; Document B). In 1891, Christopher Little—the son of the

        <p class="c4"><span class="c10">James Hepburn Campbell debuted in national politics in 1855 after being
                elected to the 34th Congress as an opposition Whig, representing Pennsylvania's 11th Congressional
                District, which included Schuylkill and Northumberland counties. (Document G). After being elected
                to the 34th Congress Campbell likely did not own any personal property in Washington D.C.; while
                keeping ownership of his Pottsville home, Campbell stayed at the National Hotel in the Capital with
                his wife. Although the National Hotel has long since been destroyed, the hotel was located at the
                northeast corner of Pennsylvania Avenue and 6th Street near the White House.</span><sup
                class="c10"><a href="#ftnt20" id="ftnt_ref20">[20]</a></sup></p>
        <p class="c3 c7"><span class="c6"></span></p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c10">Initially, Campbell did not initially accept any committee assignments in
                Congress in contempt of Pennsylvania rival and House Speaker Galusha Grow whom he believed was
                giving him “inferior assignments” (Document AX). However, whilst in the 34th Congress, Campbell
                threw in his full support toward electing Nathaniel P. Banks—an American Party congressman—as the
                new House Speaker to succeed Grow (Document AT). As a reward, Campbell was assigned to the Committee
                of Ways and Means where he leveraged his position to block any efforts to lower the 1846 Walker
                Tariff (Document AX). In 1856, Campbell made a speech on the House floor criticizing the
                Kansas-Nebraska Act and the affair between Kansas and Missouri that followed (Document H). In the
                speech, Campbell made his support of the Democratic Governor of Kansas Andrew H. </span><span
                class="c10">Reeder known</span><span class="c6">, claiming that an “invading force from the State of
                Missouri” had illegitimately placed John Wilkins Whitfield, a pro-South politician who contested
                Reeder, in power. Here, Campbell showed that he did not strictly separate himself from other
                politicians based on party lines; it was through this speech that Campbell would begin building a
                reputation for himself as a talented politician and anti-slave Republican. </span></p>
        <p class="c3 c7"><span class="c6"></span></p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c10">In 1856, Campbell again ran for a seat in the House of Representatives but
                lost reelection to the Democrat William L. Dewart.</span><sup class="c10"><a href="#ftnt21"
                    id="ftnt_ref21">[21]</a></sup><span class="c10">&nbsp;During the period of time between the 34th
                and 36th Congresses, it is plausible that Campbell returned to Pottsville as he still owned the
                property. In 1858, Campbell defeated the incumbent Dewart and was overwhelmingly reelected to the
                36th Congress representing the same district as he did previously (Document J). There, Campbell was
                assigned to the Committee of Elections but did not contribute significantly to any larger purpose or
                event (Document F). During his time in the 36th Congress, Campbell resided in the Washington
                House—also known as the United States Hotel—near Pennsylvania Avenue between 3rd and 4 ½ street with
                his wife.</span><sup class="c10"><a href="#ftnt22" id="ftnt_ref22">[22]</a></sup><span

                class="c10 c12">,</span><sup class="c10 c12"><a href="#ftnt24" id="ftnt_ref24">[24]</a></sup></p>
        <p class="c3 c7"><span class="c6"></span></p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c6">On January 11, Campbell, alongside George W. Scranton of Pennsylvania, made a
                speech on the House floor regarding the quickly shifting political landscape in America (Document
                L). In it, Campbell expressed his belief in the Union as a whole and indicated that he did not
                support regional rivalries. More importantly, Campbell directly opposed the idea of Southern
                secession, but also condemned the raid at Harpers Ferry by John Brown that happened a few months
                prior. Campbell’s reasonable stance on Southern hostility suggests that Campbell was not a so-called
                Radical Republican. In the speech, Campbell also detailed his friendship with the late Henry
                Clay—whom he supported in the 1844 Whig National Convention—and offered to support Southerner John
                Gilmer of North Carolina as House Speaker due to his close ties with Clay; Campbell also reflected
                on his support for the 1850 Compromise in his speech.</span></p>
        <p class="c3 c7"><span class="c6"></span></p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c6">On April 24, 1860, Campbell made a speech on the House floor in support of
                Representative Justin S. Morrill’s protectionist tariff (Document M). In the speech, Campbell
                referenced many trade relationships with nations such as Britain to argue for the raising of tariffs
                that would allow American workers to be more economically independent and protected. Seeing as how
                Campbell conspicuously urged the house to “[protect] everything American, against everything
                foreign,” it could be said that Campbell was a financial conservative. In part due to Campbell’s
                efforts, the Morrill Tariff Act was passed in 1861, raising tariff rates and improving tariff
                systems. </span></p>
        <p class="c3 c7"><span class="c6"></span></p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c10">As tensions between the North and South worsened in December of 1860,
                Campbell was appointed as the representative of Pennsylvania in the Committee of Thirty-Three
                following Hon. Alexander Boteler’s resolution to mediate the “perilous condition of the
                country.”</span><sup class="c10"><a href="#ftnt25" id="ftnt_ref25">[25]</a></sup><span
                class="c6">&nbsp;It was in this committee that Campbell fought against any form of compromise on
                slavery between the North and South, including the Crittenden Compromise and Corwin Amendment
                (Document AX; Document P). </span></p>
        <p class="c3 c7"><span class="c6"></span></p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c6">Following the election of Lincoln, the threat of secession from the Southern
                states led to several compromises regarding slavery to be floated from both the North and South,
                such as the Crittenden Compromise. In response, Campbell made a speech on the House floor rebuking
                any idea of compromise to the Southern states on February 14, 1861 (Document P). In the speech,
                Campbell argues that the Southern states—of which six had already vowed to secede—have no right to
                contest the election of Lincoln, and that the people had a right to see their elected president be
                inaugurated “with all the usual forms and ceremonies, without terms, without negotiation, without
                compromise, and without apology.” Campbell proceeded to describe the Crittenden Compromise as
                “despotic,” insisting that the Southern states either fall in line or betray the Union.</span></p>
        <p class="c3 c7"><span class="c6"></span></p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c10">In part due to Campbell’s staunch opposition to compromise, the Civil War
                broke out following the commencement of hostilities at Fort Sumter on April 12 of the same year.
                Upon hearing of the news, Campbell immediately rushed to the capital from his Pottsville home and
                was on the last train that passed freely through Baltimore to Washington (Document AT). After
                arriving in the city, Campbell enlisted in Cassius M. Clay’s battalion of volunteers (Document Q).
                As the battalion was initially the only troops defending Washington from Southern rebels, Clay’s
                battalion became known as the “Washington Guards”</span><sup class="c10"><a href="#ftnt26"
                    id="ftnt_ref26">[26]</a></sup><span class="c10 c12">,</span><sup class="c10"><a href="#ftnt27"

                    id="ftnt_ref28">[28]</a></sup><span class="c6">&nbsp;The battalion was disbanded within a few
                days after being relieved by professional infantry hailing from other Northern states; only a few
                days after the battalion was relieved, the 6th Massachusetts who was stationed in the city came
                under attack from a rebel mob.</span></p>
        <p class="c3 c7"><span class="c6"></span></p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c10">Following the relieving of Clay’s battalion, on April 18 of the same year,
                Campbell </span><span class="c10">formally</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;enlisted in the 25th
                Regiment of Pennslyvania Volunteers where he was elected as a Major in the F&amp;S companies
                (Document R).</span><sup class="c10"><a href="#ftnt29" id="ftnt_ref29">[29]</a></sup><span
                class="c10">&nbsp;Campbell saw little action in the 25th as the regiment was not active in direct
                combat against Confederate troops; the regiment existed only three months before it was mustered out
                of service.</span><sup class="c10"><a href="#ftnt30" id="ftnt_ref30">[30]</a></sup><span
                class="c10">&nbsp;This regiment, in a very similar fashion to the Washington Guards, was dubbed the
                ‘First Defenders’ due to its immediate response to Lincoln’s call for troops.</span><sup
                class="c10"><a href="#ftnt31" id="ftnt_ref31">[31]</a></sup><span class="c6">&nbsp;As the regiment
                had only been formed on a three-month term, Campbell was honorably discharged from the regiment in
                July.</span></p>
        <p class="c3 c24"><span class="c6"></span></p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c6">After returning from his military service, Campbell again returned to
                Congress as he was elected in October of 1860 to the 37th Congress representing his usual district
                (Document N). In the 37th Congress, Campbell was initially appointed to the Committee of Elections,
                the Committee on Expenditures in the Treasury Department, and the Committee of Public Expenditures
                (Document F). During the 37th Congress, Campbell again resided in the Washington House hotel with
                his wife (Document O). </span></p>
        <p class="c3 c7"><span class="c6"></span></p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c6">In March of 1862, the stalemate on the Eastern front of the Civil War near
                the Potomac drove many Republicans to pressure the White House for immediate and decisive action.
                Among them was Campbell, who, alongside William M. Davis of Pennsylvania and John Hutchins of Ohio,
                visited and interviewed Lincoln (Document S). In his recollection, Campbell explained how
                Congressmen should consult with the president instead of attacking him; Campbell also urged the
                President to break the Confederate presence near the Potomac and Capitol. To this, Lincoln hinted
                towards a possible offensive by General George McLellan. </span></p>
        <p class="c3 c7"><span class="c6"></span></p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c6">Although Campbell did not do anything of significance in his other
                committees, he was later appointed as the Chairman of the Select Committee on the Pacific Railroad
                in 1862 (Document T). On the Committee, Campbell oversaw the organization of the first
                transcontinental railroad from Missouri to California and advocated for the adoption of the central
                route following Southern secession (Document AQ). On April 8, 1862, Campbell made a speech on the
                House floor emphasizing the importance of a transcontinental railroad, arguing that the construction
                of a Pacific Railroad would better unify the country (Document U). Campbell argued that both
                communication and transportation would be revolutionized with its construction; his familiarity with
                the intricate details of the railroad’s plans indicated that Campbell was closely involved with the
                railroad itself. </span></p>
        <p class="c3 c7"><span class="c6"></span></p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c6">On June 24 of the same year, Congress, with Campbell as the sponsor of the
                bill, passed the Pacific Railway Act of 1862 with the Senate’s amendments (Document V); the bill was
                signed into law by Abraham Lincoln on July 1st of the same year. This bill, alongside Campbell’s
                related speech, can be reasonably viewed as the pinnacle of Campbell’s career—as the Pacific Railway
                Acts were among the most influential pieces of legislation regarding economics and trade in the
                U.S., Campbell’s efforts, although unrecognized, have had a permanent effect on the growth of
                America as a nation and economic powerhouse. </span></p>
        <p class="c3 c7"><span class="c6"></span></p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c6">Only a week before he would pass the first Pacific Railway Act through
                Congress, Campbell voted in favor of the Morrill Land-Grant Acts—a bill that created land-grant
                colleges like Penn State and MIT from the proceeds of land sales (Document V). However, as these
                land sales were infamous for having been sourced from the exploitation of Native lands, it could be
                argued that Campbell was not particularly sensitive to the plight of the Native Americans at the
                time. It does show, however, that Campbell was a supporter of the expansion of higher education.
            </span></p>
        <p class="c3 c7"><span class="c6"></span></p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c6">After Campbell’s defeat in the 1862 Congressional elections, Campbell
                recounted in his letters to his wife how Secretary of the Senate John W. Forney notified him of
                Lincoln’s particular regret in Campbell’s political defeat; it can be seen here that Campbell may
                have held a relatively close relationship with the President (Document S). In January of 1863,
                Campbell was received by Mrs. Abraham Lincoln at the White House, where he, alongside General Simon
                Cameron, “gossiped” with the First Lady about her Southern heritage.</span></p>
        <p class="c3 c7"><span class="c6"></span></p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c10">On February 25th of the same year, Campbell voted in favor of the monumental
                Enrollment Act; the Enrollment Act, also the Civil War Military Draft Act, was essentially the first
                conscription legislation passed in the U.S. Campbell’s support of this act possibly derives from his
                “vigorous military methods” and intolerance for secession.</span><sup class="c10"><a href="#ftnt32"
                    id="ftnt_ref32">[32]</a></sup><span class="c6">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="c3 c24"><span class="c6"></span></p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c6">In June of 1863, Campbell again registered for the military draft following
                Governor Andrew Curtin’s call for volunteers (Document Y). He did not serve as an infantryman,
                however; Campbell alongside General James Nagle privately raised the 39th Regiment of Pennsylvania
                Volunteer Militia following General Robert E. Lee’s advance into southern Pennsylvania (Document A;
                Document AQ). The unit, composed mostly of men from Schuylkill County, did not actively contribute
                to combat as Lee’s troops had already begun a southern retreat following the decisive Northern
                victory at Gettysburg (Document B). The regiment merely followed the footprints of Lee’s army in the
                campaign to pursue and destroy Lee. Campbell was left in charge of the regiment as a lieutenant
                colonel after James Nagle was promoted to Brigadier General. The regiment was mustered out of
                service nearly a month after its formation (Document Z).</span></p>
        <p class="c3 c7"><span class="c6"></span></p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c10">In the 1862 Congressional elections, the unpopularity of the Civil
                War—particularly in the Schuylkill and Northumberland counties he represented—led to Campbell’s
                failed election to the 38th Congress (Document S). Following the end of his term in the 37th
                Congress and service in the military, Campbell was personally recommended via letter by many highly
                influential figures and politicians to serve as a diplomatic mission on behalf of the U.S. (Document
                W; Document X). Based on the contents of such letters, Campbell had many connections to prominent
                politicians including former Pennsylvania </span><span class="c10">Governors</span><span
                class="c6">&nbsp;James Pollock and Andrew Curtin as well as former Vice President Hannibal Hamlin.
                As such, in 1864, Campbell was appointed by then-President Abraham Lincoln to serve as the Minister
                Resident to Sweden and Norway; Campbell served this station from the years 1864-1867 (Document AC;
                Document AJ). Campbell notably declined the offer of the Lincoln administration to be assigned as a
                judge on the Court for the Suppression of the Slave Trade in Cape Town, South Africa before
                accepting this position (Document AX).</span></p>
        <p class="c3 c7"><span class="c6"></span></p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c10">On July 22, 1864, Secretary of State William H. Seward wrote a request to
                the relevant European nations to provide free travel for Campbell in preparation for his arrival in
                Stockholm (Document AD). As such, on September 17, 1864, Campbell arrived unmolested in Stockholm
                with his family through the German cities of Cologne and Lubeck (Document AE). There, he secured an
                apartment for his stay and began preparations for the assumption of duty from his predecessor Jacob
                S. Haldeman. Shortly after his arrival, Campbell met for an interview with the Swedish Prime
                Minister of Foreign Affairs Count Ludvig Manderstrom where he made a fantastic first impression
                while discussing the Civil War. On the 24th and 25th, Campbell met with King Charles XV and Queen
                Lovisa of Sweden separately in </span><span class="c10">Ulriksdale</span><span
                class="c6">&nbsp;Palace, remarking that he “could not have been received more kindly by any
                gentleman in Europe.”</span></p>
        <p class="c3 c7"><span class="c6"></span></p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c6">&nbsp;While only a portion of his activities are readily documented, it is
                known that Campbell worked to construct greater relations between the Swedish and American states by
                acquiring the language and culture while touring the country as the Minister Resident (Document AE;
                Document AQ). To this effect, Campbell participated in various cultural and social celebrations such
                as the fiftieth anniversary of the union between Sweden and Norway (Document AE).</span></p>
        <p class="c3 c7"><span class="c6"></span></p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c6">In December, Campbell handled his first, albeit small, diplomatic conflict
                where he made it known to Count Manderstrom the American government’s displeasure that Sweden had
                dispatched Baron Nils de Wetterstedt as an envoy to the Mexican Empire (not to be confused with the
                Republic of Mexico). Prior to his arrival as a Minister to the U.S., Wetterstedt had been sent on
                diplomatic business to the French-backed Mexican Empire that the U.S. deemed illegitimate.
                Nevertheless, Campbell and Manderstrom maintained a light mood throughout their meeting, with the
                two joking that Russia, who also dispatched an envoy to the Mexican Empire, was no better a friend
                to America than Sweden. This interaction likely indicates that Campbell generally handled diplomatic
                affairs in Sweden cordially and professionally. </span></p>
        <p class="c3 c7"><span class="c6"></span></p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c6">In early 1865, it is likely that Campbell traveled across Europe,
                specifically France and Paris. On May 23, 1865, the Swedish Prime Minister’s Office for External
                Affairs requested that the nations of Prussia, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, and France grant
                Campbell free travel after Campbell had “communicated his desire to travel” to these countries
                (Document AI). Based on this desire, as well as the Office’s request, it is likely that Campbell
                traveled across Europe in 1865; this could possibly be related to the recent shift in the European
                political realm following the Second Schleswig War and its influence on Scandinavia (Document
                AE).</span></p>
        <p class="c3 c7"><span class="c6"></span></p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c10">Before the Foreign Office issued the laissez-passer request for Campbell, it
                is likely he had already traveled to Paris for a short period of time (Document AI). Campbell’s
                presence in Paris at this time can be verified by his induction as one of the Presidents d’Honneur
                of the Institut d’Afrique in Paris in February of 1865 (Document AH). The Institut d’Afrique was a
                French organization formed in 1838 to push for the abolition of the slave trade but also advocated
                the colonization of Africa.</span><sup class="c10"><a href="#ftnt33"
                    id="ftnt_ref33">[33]</a></sup><span class="c10">&nbsp;Seeing as how the Institut d’Afrique
                supported colonization, Campbell himself may have also supported colonization whilst opposing
                slavery. In the letter of his induction, the General Secretary of the Institute wrote how the
                organization would be “flattered” to have him as a President d’Honneur; this likely indicated that
                Campbell’s efforts to abolish the slave trade were recognized internationally. Based on how the
                Institut </span><span class="c10">d’Afrique’s</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;members were almost
                exclusively composed of members in Paris, and how the title of President d’Honneur had a membership
                fee of at least 20 francs, it can be inferred that Campbell may have stayed in Paris for a period of
                time in 1865.</span></p>
        <p class="c3 c7"><span class="c6"></span></p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c6">A glimpse into Campbell’s ability was shown shortly before the end of the
                Civil War in March-April of 1865 when he potentially foiled a Confederate plot to procure a Swedish
                vessel for the purpose of piracy (Document AG). In the letters between Minister Resident to Denmark
                Bradford Wood and Campbell, it was said that Confederate agents had been “prowling” Copenhagen in
                search of a merchant vessel to purchase and arm. As a precaution, Campbell placed the U.S. consuls
                at Swedish and Norwegian ports on high alert against potential Confederate activity and offered to
                notify the Swedish authorities on the matter. Though it was only days later that the Confederacy
                would surrender and end the Civil War, this could be seen as one of the more noteworthy affairs in
                Campbell’s service as Resident Minister as it displayed his competence and decisiveness in a time of
                stress. </span></p>
        <p class="c3 c7"><span class="c6"></span></p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c6">Campbell also served as the channel through which diplomatic correspondences
                between the two countries—such as the condolences of the Swedish king following President Abraham
                Lincoln’s assassination—were conveyed (Document AF). Following the assassination plot on President
                Lincoln and Secretary of State William H. Seward, Campbell wrote a letter to Seward where he
                reported the reaction of the Swedish people to the assassination and wished Seward a hasty recovery.
                Notably, Campbell revealed his reverence for Lincoln and wrote how Lincoln, whom he “knew and loved
                as a personal friend,” dedicated his life to the Union and preserved American liberty. The death of
                Lincoln likely deeply affected Campbell as he had interacted with the late President on more than
                one occasion, particularly when meeting with him in early 1862 (Document S).</span></p>
        <p class="c3 c7"></p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c6">On November 15, 1866, it was decided by the Johnson administration that John
                McGinnis was to replace Campbell as Minister Resident and that Campbell was to be appointed as
                Minister Resident to Colombia in Bogota (Document AJ). However, these decisions were yet to be
                passed through the Senate, and McGinnis’ appointment would ultimately be rebuffed by a Senate vote.
                As such, Campbell did not meet McGinnis in Paris to organize the transfer of power to his successor.
            </span></p>

        <p class="c3 c24"></p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c10">On March 29, Campbell presented a recall and exchanged thanks with King
                Charles in the Royal Palace where he was afforded a ceremonious farewell by the Royal
                family.</span><sup class="c10"><a href="#ftnt34" id="ftnt_ref34">[34]</a></sup><span
                class="c10">&nbsp;After his term as Minister Resident to Sweden-Norway ended, the newly-inaugurated
                President Andrew Johnson offered Campbell the aforementioned second diplomatic post as the Minister
                Resident to Colombia in Bogota; however, Campbell rejected this position in protest of the Johnson
                administration which was sympathetic to the South (Document AJ; Document AQ).</span><sup
                class="c10"><a href="#ftnt35" id="ftnt_ref35">[35]</a></sup><span class="c6">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="c3 c7"></p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c6">Before his return to America on June 14, 1867, Campbell was elected as a
                Companion of the First Class of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States (MOLLUS)
                (Document AK). MOLLUS, whilst sounding like a military award, was actually one of the first military
                fraternal organizations; MOLLUS was formed following the assassination of Lincoln as an organization
                of officers that fought in the Civil War. First Class Companions of the Order such as Campbell were
                composed of only veteran commissioned officers of the U.S. Army who fought in the Civil War. Notable
                members of MOLLUS included Ulysses S. Grant, Rutherford B. Hayes, William McKinley, and George
                Custer.</span></p>
        <p class="c3 c7"></p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c10">In August of 1867, Campbell officially moved back to the States and took
                residence in Philadelphia to resume the practice of law (Document S; Document AQ). It is probable
                that around this time Campbell purchased a property at 2039 Delaney Place in Philadelphia to reside
                with his wife and daughter, Julia Ver Planck (Document AM).</span><sup class="c10"><a href="#ftnt36"
                    id="ftnt_ref36">[36]</a></sup><span class="c10">&nbsp;Julia initially moved away from Campbell
                to live with her husband, but moved back following the death of her husband and sons.</span><sup
                class="c10"><a href="#ftnt37" id="ftnt_ref37">[37]</a></sup></p>
        <p class="c3 c7"></p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c6">Despite a shortage of city records during the period, it is known that by
                1876 Campbell was working at a law firm at 130 S 6th Street—the street also known as “Lawyer’s
                Row”—with other prominent lawyers (Document AL). While he was working at this firm, Campbell worked
                on numerous prominent cases such as the 1883 Packer Estate case, which was elevated to the
                Pennsylvania Supreme Court (Document AN). In the case, Campbell represented the estate of Barnabas
                Hammett; The Supreme Court ruled that guardians, after initiating a legal case for a minor, no
                longer have authority after the minor becomes an adult. </span></p>
        <p class="c3 c7"><span class="c6"></span></p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c10">Campbell’s life slowed down following his departure from politics, and
                Campbell bought a separate estate for his family in Wayne, PA. The estate, known as “</span><span
                class="c10">Aeola</span><span class="c6">,” was located at 705 Church Rd in Wayne (Document AU). In
                a photograph taken in 1898, three years after his death, the estate appeared very large and
                well-kept, with a path going around the house and deliberate maintenance of plants and decorations.
                In Allan Peskin’s “Two White House Visits,” the estate is described as a “farm,” which is
                corroborated by the large plot of land the house occupies on satellite imagery (Document S).</span>
        </p>

        <p class="c3 c7"><span class="c6"></span></p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c10">&nbsp;Based on Campbell’s absence
            in Gopsill’s 1887 Philadelphia city directory, Campbell retired from his practice of law at 130 S
            6th Street and dedicated the rest of his years to agriculture at his </span><span
            class="c10">Aeola</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;estate (Document AT).</span><sup class="c10"><a
                href="#ftnt38" id="ftnt_ref38">[38]</a></sup><span class="c6">&nbsp;In June of 1893, Campbell
            celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of his marriage to his wife Juliet at the estate (Document AP).
            Campbell, who was the only surviving son of Francis C. Campbell by 1893, invited old friends from
            across the country to attend the lavish celebration.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c3 c7"><span class="c6"></span></p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c10">On April 12, 1895, James
            Hepburn Campbell passed away due to heart failure at the age of 75 at his </span><span
            class="c10">Aeola</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;estate (Document AS). His daughter, Julia Wharton
            Lewis Keightley, planned to spend the summer with her parents after arriving in Philadelphia from
            London, but was instead met with the news of her father’s passing (Document AT). His funeral was
            held at St. Mary’s Church in Wayne on April 17 at 10:45 A.M.</span><sup class="c10"><a
                href="#ftnt39" id="ftnt_ref39">[39]</a></sup><span class="c6">&nbsp;Campbell was interned the
            same day at the Woodlands Cemetery where the rest of his family was also buried.</span>
        </p>
                
        <p class="c4"><span class="c10">After his death, James Hepburn Campbell left behind a remarkable legacy of
                public service, resilience, and honor to the abolition of slavery and the Union. From his admission
                to the Bar in 1841 to his appointment as Minister Resident to Sweden-Norway, Campbell fought for
                justice, order, and to build harmonious relations both in and outside the U.S. On countless
                occasions Campbell's ability as an orator and politician was put on full display; his legacy was
                immortalized in his sponsoring of the famous Pacific Railway Act of 1862. Despite setbacks such as
                the loss of his sons and defeat in the 1862 elections, Campbell remained dedicated to fulfilling his
                duty as a patriotic American. Campbell's life, marked by both private and professional achievements,
                stands out in history as an example of steadfast dedication and selfless service to one's nation and
                community. </span></p>
